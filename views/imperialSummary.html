<p>The Nguyen Dynasty had its source from Gia Mieu Ngoai Trang village, Thuong Ban canton, Tong Son district, Ha Trung prefecture, Thanh Hoa province. The place name Gia Mieu Ngoai Trang was changed to Qui Huong, and Tong Son to Qui Huyen in the Gia Long&#39;s reign.</p>
<p>In the days of old, before the Nguyen Dynasty, our family name was Nguyen Van. Grand Duke Trung, Emperor Trieu To (Nguyen Kim)&#39;s father, was named Nguyen Van Luu.</p>
<p>In the reight of Emperor Minh Mang (1820-1840), this distinction was noted: Ton-that Nguyen versus Cong Tanh Nguyen Huu. Those who followed Lord Nguyen Hoang to the South bore the family name Ton-that Nguyen Phuong, and those who stayed in the North bore the family name Cong Tanh Nguyen Huu. But at present only the family name Ton-that or Nguyen Huu is used, e.g. Ton-that Mo or Nguyen Huu Mo.</p>
